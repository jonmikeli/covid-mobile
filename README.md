# Covid data gatherer

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to build a simple solution allowing to gather data related to covid-19 from all around the world.

Data will be related to symptoms and how people live the disease.
what is targetted behind is to provide to the community as much data as possible about what people has been experiencing.

## Solution
The approach in mind is to use the already very extense market of cell phones all around the world.
However, instead of using a regular data flow approach through APIs, queues or message brokers (for instance, Event Hub, Kafka), using IoT oriented services could beneficial and profitable for many use cases.

The creative aspect of the proposed solution resides on the fact that there is no IoT device. That role will be played by an application embedded in a mobile application (phone application).
